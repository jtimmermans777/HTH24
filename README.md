# HackTheHeights24
Project made during Hack The Heights 2024, Boston College's annual hackathon. 
Credits to Jack Timmermans for UI design (base.html), myself (Vincent Park) for integrating the backend to the frontend (flaskmain.py and base.html) and Matthew Leopold and Salamun Nuhin for model detection design with openCV & mongoDB (every other file other than the ones aforementioned).
